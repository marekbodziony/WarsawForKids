# WarsawForKids

<b>WarsawForKids</b> ia an Android app. This app is dedicated for parents which looking for interesting place in Warsaw to go with their children. There are six cathegories: <b>Events, Attractions, Places, Parks, Playgrounds and Restaurants</b>.

Application is connected with Firebase realtime databse. Firebase uses JSON format to store data, I have created a tool to generates JSON file with data - [JSON-gen-for-Firebase](https://github.com/marekbodziony/JSON-gen-for-Firebase). This tool adds elements with specified values (name, date of event, description, www, gps, ratings, likes) to JSON file, then saves the file in 'firebase.json', which can be uploaded to Firebase.

Actual version of app can be downloaded as [apk](https://github.com/marekbodziony/WarsawForKids/raw/master/warsaw4kids.apk) and install on device.
